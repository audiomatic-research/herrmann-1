        <b>Abstract</b>
        This paper presents Herrmann-1, a multi-modal framework to generate
        background music tailored to movie scenes, by integrating
        state-of-the-art vision, language, music, and speech processing models.
        Our pipeline begins by extracting visual and speech information from a
        movie scene, performing emotional analysis on it, and converting these
        into descriptive texts. Then, GPT-4 translates these high-level
        descriptions into low-level music conditions. Finally, these text-based
        music conditions guide a text-to-music model to generate music that
        resonates with input movie scenes. Comprehensive objective and
        subjective evaluations attest to the high synthesis quality, congruence,
        and superiority of our pipeline.

                Ethereal orchestral piece with soft piano undertones, interlaced
                with melancholic violin solos, reminiscent of historical
                romance. Very gentle harp plucks accentuate moments of intimacy,

                melodies interspersed, evoking the vastness of the ocean and the

                of timeless romance and the breathtaking moments of connection
                between two souls. As the story unfolds, subtle choral harmonies
                emerge, giving depth and warmth, encapsulating the nostalgia and
                longing found in epic tales of love.
